# Budget-Tracker
The user will enter the menu with two options, login and categorize expenses. If the user selects
login, it will prompt the user to login. If the user is not already registered, the user can sign up
and then login. Once logged in, the system will enter the expense database. In the other menu
option (data expenses), the user will be able to create a categorized expense sheet from a
selection of options.
1. Create Notification
2. Create Budget
3. Input Expenses
4. Generate Report
5. Exit

The user can complete these in any order. At any time, if the user wants to create a notification,
the user can create a message to a selected categorized expense sheet. From the categorized
expenses, the user can create a budget for their category that they would like to create. With the
new budget, the user can input expenses into the categorized expenses database. Then the
user can create a report if wanted. If not, the user will be able to exit the database and head
back into the main menu
